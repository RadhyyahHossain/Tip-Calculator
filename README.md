## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:
 
- [x] Added more tip percentages options.
- [x] Created a "Split Total by Number of People" field to calculate how much to split the total after tip by. 
- [x] Created a "Each Person Pays" section that calculates how much each person pays based on the total after tip and the "Split Total by Number of People"
- [x] Created a seperate Settings Page that enables light and dark mode.
- [x] Used Lottie animations to add an animation in the main screen for user enjoyment.
